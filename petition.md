## Facts

1. Spotify commonly combines stream numbers for different versions of the same song to determine the total number of streams for that song. <sup><a href="#one">[1]</a></sup>
     
     On March 26, 2023, Jimin's track, "Like Crazy," ranked at #1 on Spotify's daily Global Top Songs chart with a little over 6 million streams. He received press from various online outlets for this, being the first Korean soloist to do so.<sup><a href="#two">[2]</a></sup> This number includes the streams for the English and Korean versions of the song.
 
     The day after this happened, on March 27, Spotify split the streams so that the English and Korean versions were considered different tracks. The reason for this split was that Spotify removed one of the producers, Ghstloop, from the credits for the Korean version.<sup><a href="#three">[3]</a></sup> There are only two producers on this track, Pdogg and Ghstloop. This change was incorrect and did not reflect the credits included in the album.<sup><a href="#four">[4]</a></sup>

     On their own webpage, Spotify states that it is up to the "label or distributor to fix issues with... songwriter/producer credits. [The artist's] label or distributor needs to send a metadata update to us with the right info. <b><i>We can't change this manually on our end because we show music according to the metadata sent to us.</i></b>"<sup><a href="#five">[5]</a></sup> Taking this statement at face value, this means that it is the label's responsibility to provide and update metadata for that track, not Spotify's. <mark>Taking this statement at face value, this means that Jimin's label, BigHit, initially sent correct metadata for both versions of the song, but then sent a factually false metadata update to Spotify for the Korean version after the track hit #1.</mark>
 
     Splitting the stream numbers caused "Like Crazy" to fall to #14 on Spotify's Global Top Songs chart. Jimin's critics on social media used this as an opportunity to tout this drop as a tie with another artist's song for "the biggest non-holiday drop from #1 on the global Spotify chart in HISTORY both dropping (-13)."<sup><a href="#six">[6]</a></sup> However, the streams for the Korean version on March 27 were at 3.48 million, and the English version streams were at 2.63 million.<sup><a href="#seven">[7]</a></sup> This combined for a little over 6.11 streams, which was actually a higher number than when the track first hit #1. If the streams had stayed combined, the track would have remained at #1, increasing its visibility with Spotify's audience.

2. Jimin's song, "Like Crazy," debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the tracking week of 04/08/2023.<sup><a href="#eight">[8]</a></sup> He received press and social media attention for this, being the first Korean soloist to do so.<sup><a href="#nine">[9]</a></sup> For this first tracking week, Hits Daily Double, a music industry trade publication, projected that "Like Crazy" sold 241,000 copies.<sup><a href="#ten">[10]</a></sup>  This matched Billboard's tally of 254,000 (241,000 digital plus 13,000 physical) for that first week.<sup><a href="#eleven">[11]</a></sup>

     On the next week of tracking (04/15/2023), Hits Daily Double reported that Jimin sold an additional 120,000 copies of "Like Crazy." However, Billboard reported that only 14,800 copies were sold for this same tracking week.<sup><a href="#twelve">[12]</a></sup> <b><i>Despite having matching tallies for that first tracking week, somehow, on the second week of tracking, there was now a discrepancy of over 100,000 copies between the two charts.</i></b>

     Due to fans organizing buying campaigns to reach certain numbers, fans were able to determine that these missing sales were from the official BTS store, an online store that sells digital downloads.<sup><a href="#thirteen">[13]</a></sup> I am not here to argue for or against buying campaigns. <mark>I am only here to note that the only missing sales came from a store that Jimin's label manages.</mark> Fans also noted that sales of other artists' songs from this website were being counted for Billboard, as they were able to match the sales numbers on the Digital Song Sales chart. Only Jimin's sales from the online store were not being counted.<sup><a href="#fourteen">[14]</a></sup>

     Entirely omitting the sales from BigHit's online store caused "Like Crazy" to fall to #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the tracking week of 04/15/2023.<sup><a href="#fifteen">[15]</a></sup> Jimin's critics on social media used this as an opportunity to label it as the "biggest fall from #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in HISTORY as it falls to #45."<sup><a href="#sixteen">[16]</a></sup> However, if the numbers had been correctly tallied, the track would have been at #6 for that second week.

3. Hanteo is an online platform for the Korean music industry that tracks album sales in real-time. Fans were tracking sales of Jimin's album, Face, through Hanteo's website and mobile app on the day of release. At the fifth hour of tracking, sales were at almost 1.2 million when the website froze. The website was then modified to show the sales number to be under 1 million. The sales number would begin rising again, only for it to freeze again and be modified again to be a lower number. This occurred several different times, causing Jimin's album sales to cross the 1 million sale threshold multiple times.<sup><a href="#seventeen">[needs citation]</a></sup> The website finally stopped updates entirely and removed the entire chart, hiding it from the public.<sup><a href="#eighteen">[18]</a></sup>

     <b><i>However, as the website was freezing and resetting sales numbers, the PC version of the app kept running and showed Jimin's sales tally to be at 1.75 million.</i></b><sup><a href="#nineteen">[19]</a></sup> In addition, tallies of other artists' album sales on this app matched their tallies on the website. Only Jimin's sales on the PC version did not match the website.<sup><a href="#twenty">[needs citation]</a></sup>

     At the end of the tracking day, Hanteo released a statement that Jimin's first-day sales were 991,437, just under one million.<sup><a href="#twenty-one">[21]</a></sup> Fans had been taking screenshots of the sales numbers and started to mass-tweet and mass-email these screenshots to Hanteo. Hanteo responded with a statement that anyone taking screenshots of their websites would be subject to "imprisonment of up to 5 years or fines of up to 50 million won under the copyright law."<sup><a href="#twenty-two">[22]</a></sup> Finally, Hanteo changed the sales number again - this time to 1,021,532, just over one million in sales.<sup><a href="#twenty-three">[23]</a></sup>

     There is still no real proof as to what the actual sales number is or what Hanteo's motives might be. <mark>However, one critic noted that Hanteo can only count album sales if the albums are shipped. Jimin's company, BigHit, handles album shipments in Korea.</mark><sup><a href="#twenty-four">[needs citation]</a></sup> There are no current facts to prove this; however, it remains a possibility until proven otherwise.

4. <b><i>Despite hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, "Like Crazy" was never serviced to any radio format.</i></b> "Serviced" means to send the song to radio stations for their consideration. It does not mean a promotional campaign; it does not mean spending considerable resources to push the song. It means simply sending the track to radio stations and is commonly done by record labels for even smaller indie artists. BigHit never sent the track to a single radio format.

5. Jimin's album was released on March 24, 2023. On March 28, four days later, he had a live video broadcast to fans in which he announced that he had finished filming his last promotional performance for this album.<sup><a href="#twenty-five">[25]</a></sup> On April 5, 2023, Jimin published a thank-you message to fans, stating that his promotional period had ended and that he wondered if it ended too quickly.<sup><a href="#twenty-six">[26]</a></sup> He was given a promotional period of less than two weeks. This was due to Jimin's bandmate starting his own promotional period three weeks before his own album release.

     His bandmate appeared on a talk show, saying that his album was initially supposed to be released earlier in the year, but he chose to postpone it to a later date.<sup><a href="#twenty-seven">[27]</a></sup> <b><i>Jimin's label allowed this and arranged for his bandmate to begin promotional activities during the second week of Jimin's album release.</i></b> Instead of allowing both of them to promote at the same time, the label cut Jimin's promotional period short - so that his bandmate could have a three week pre-release period, followed up by a documentary, three music videos, talk show appearances in Korea and the US, and a three-month international tour, while Jimin received less than two weeks to promote his album and also had his request for a third music video denied.<sup><a href="#twenty-eight">[needs citation]</a></sup>

## Petition

I am not saying that Jimin should receive special treatment. I am not even saying that Jimin should receive equal treatment to his bandmates. I am saying that, given his past success and the amount of money he has made his record label, Jimin deserves a decent level of opportunity and a decent period of promotion time, which he did not receive for his first album. <mark>He was not allowed to succeed or fail on his own merit. His label intentionally hindered him so that he could not succeed to his full potential.</mark>

Free Jimin from his record label. Free Jimin for a record label that will treat him fairly.
